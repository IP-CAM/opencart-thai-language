Thai Language Pack for OpenCart

OpenCart is from https://www.opencart.com .

## story

On September 25, 2013, we uploaded the latest version of our OpenCart
Thai language pack to OpenCart's extension directory.  At that time, the
current version of OpenCart was 1.5.6.1.  It was translated by
@wkwanchanok and PHP files were prepared by @bhchutima.

On May 16, 2017, we went to OpenCart.com and found that our extension
pack was already gone, of course.

We decide to migrate it to GitHub instead.  Updates to the language pack
will be followed... soon!
